Wow. What an audience. But if i'm being honest. I don't care what you think of my talk. Cuz they're the ones who get it seen and get it shared. And i think that's where most people get it wrong they're talking to you. Here. Stop talking to you. Random person. Scrolling facebook. Thanks for the click. You see back in 2009 we all had these weird little things called. Attention spans. I'm trying to think of the last time i watched an 18 minute ted talk. It's been. Literally years. So if you're giving a ted talk. Keep it quick. I'm doing mine and under a minute. I'm at 44 seconds right now that means we got time for one final joke. Why are balloons so expensive. Inflation.
